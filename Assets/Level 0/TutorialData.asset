  movementTutorial:
  - 'You there, mate? '
  - I promise, this planet won't be as hard as the last one.
  - 'By the way, I fixed your suit. Didn''t do anything funny with it. '
  - 'A and D to move, Space to jump.  '
  - 'See whether you can find any mindless beasts to exterminate. '
  - Over.
  shootingTutorial:
  - 'Ugh, what''s that? '
  - 'Smells like cheap cigarettes. '
  - 'Oh THIS wanker. '
  - 'Oh THIS wanker. '
  - 'You know, the type of guy who likes tall ugly buildings and listens to sad music. '
  - Sounds like unintelligent life form to me.
  - 'Crush his sorrow arse. '
  - 'Use your mouse to shoot. '
  - 'Alternatively, you can press CTRL.   '
  - If you run out of ammo, just press R to reload.
  - Simple as.
  - Over.
  goalTutorial:
  - 'Nice! '
  - 'One less chump. '
  - 'You might encounter other monsters and I''m afraid your gun won''t damage them. '
  - 'Luckily for you, I attuned your gun to shoot multicoloured bullets. '
  - 'Just press right mouse button (or ALT) to change your current colour. '
  - 'There is an indicator in top left corner. '
  - 'Use the same colour as your enemies to deal them damage. '
  - 'Shooting different colour won''t do any harm to them, so don''t waste your time. '
  - Make your way to the ship.
  - 'I''ll be waiting you there. '
  - 'ALSO, look out for the treasure chests. '
  - Over and out.
